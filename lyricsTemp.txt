[Verse 1: Aimer &amp; Vaundy]Hungry for loveTime and time againWe comfort each other emotionallySimple and clearStraightforward and subtleWe are carried away with each other on a night like this[Pre-Chorus: Aimer]Why don&#x27;t we let ourselves be tossedOn this hell of a night?Hey ah ah ah ah[Chorus: Both]What can I do for this motion?Put a name to a memorable nightWhat can I do for this motion?Let me see you dance to the night that&#x27;s driving you crazy[Post-Chorus: Both]La-la, la-la, la-la, la-laLa-la, la-la, la-la, la-la[Verse 2: Aimer &amp; Vaundy]Gradually filled with loveToday once againWe huddle against each other&#x27;s emotionsWe&#x27;ve left behind somewhereLove and then someThat must have been carried away on a night like this
[Pre-Chorus: Aimer]Why don&#x27;t we forget about itDancing to this hell of a nightNee ah ah ah ah[Chorus: Both]What can I do for this motion?Put a name to a memorable nightWhat can I do for this motion?Let me see you dance to the night that&#x27;s driving you crazy[Bridge: Aimer]I want to keep holding on to this pathetic dreamAccumulating againAh ah ah ah[Chorus: Both]What can I do for this motion?Put a name to a memorable nightWhat can I do for this motion?Let me see you dance to the night that&#x27;s driving you crazy[Post-Chorus: Both &amp; Aimer]Why don&#x27;t we kick away the rolling map of the future (What can I do for this motion?)And keep on smiling?With a map we drew together in our hands (What can I do for this motion?)I want to keep on smiling with you
[Outro: Both]La-la, la-la, la-la, la-laLa-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
