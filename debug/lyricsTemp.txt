[Intro]If you&#x27;ve ever wondered whyDisney tales all end in liesHere&#x27;s what happened after all their dreams came true[Verse 1 - Ariel]I loved being princess down in this beautiful ocean-blueBut mermaids are going missing, they end up in someone&#x27;s stewSo, just try to put yourself into somebody else&#x27;s gillsYou&#x27;re killing my ecosystem with fishing and oil spills (Oh no)Thank you BP, thank you BPThe British are killing, oil is spillingNow, I can&#x27;t see! My eyes!Chinamen feast on Flounder&#x27;s finsPlus the Japanese killed all my whale friendsOceans are browning, I think I&#x27;m drowningThanks to BPYou suck![Verse 2 - Jasmine]Hey, I&#x27;m okay, but I&#x27;m slightly scaredMy husband&#x27;s a mark for the War on TerrorAladdin was taken by the CIAWe&#x27;re non-TalibanYou&#x27;ve got the wrong manIn Guantanamo BayPrince Ali, where could he be? Drowning in WawaInterrogation from the nation of the &quot;Free&quot;Bin Laden&#x27;s taken the fallWe&#x27;re not trained pilots at allJafar went crazy and no one put up a fussWe&#x27;re for freedom, Genie can vouch for usBush was crazy, Obama&#x27;s lazy, Al-Qaeda&#x27;s not in this countrySet free my Prince Ali
[Verse 3 - Belle]A whore! A whore!A whore, a whore, a whore!This town&#x27;s gone wild since I married AdamThey think I&#x27;m going straight to hell (She&#x27;ll burn, in hell)But the charges laid on me, of bestialityCould wind-up getting me thrown in a cell (She is a witch)No, I&#x27;m overrun by mad-men (We&#x27;re all crazy)I hear they plan to burn me at the stake(The witch will fry, that Belle must die)They legit believe I&#x27;m SatanAnd now I hear that PETA&#x27;s gonna take my beast away[Verse 4 - Pocahontas]After John Smith traveled back to EnglandI helped my people cultivate the fieldsMore English, French and Spaniards came to visitAnd they greeted us with guns and germs and steelThey forced us into unknown lands of exileThey pillaged, raped and left us all for deadSo now, I&#x27;m far more liberal with a weaponWhen I separate their bodies from their heads (Wait, what?)Have you ever held the entrails of an English guy?Or bit the beating hearts of Spanish men?Can you shoot an arrow in some French guy&#x27;s eyeball? (Sacrebleu!)Can you paint with the red colors in these men? (Adios, amigos)I can murder if I please&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m dying of diseaseI can paint with the red colors in these men
